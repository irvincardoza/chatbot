# Test Model - BERT Fine-Tuning  

This is a test model fine-tuned using a **BERT** model, designed to work with a **preloaded context file** for generating responses. The model leverages **context retrieval** to improve answer accuracy. Currently, efforts are underway to enhance performance by transitioning to a **FlanT5** model for better generalization and response quality.
